# AtomVM ADC Example Program

The `adc_example` program illustrates use of the ADC API by reading the voltage signal on pin 34 once every second, and displaying the result on the console.

> Note.  Building and flashing the `adc_example` program requires installation of the [`rebar3`](https://www.rebar3.org) Erlang build tool.

To run this example program, you will need to connect a power source to pin 34 on your ESP32 device, such as through a power supply (e.g., DPH5005), and provide it with a voltage between 0 and 1 volts.  Connect the negative lead on your power supply to the ground pin on your ESP32.

> Important!  Do not supply the GPIO pin reading voltage with more than 3.6v, or you risk damaging your device.

Build the example program and flash to your device:

    shell$ cd .../AtomVM/src/platforms/esp32/components/atomvm_dht/examples/adc_example
    shell$ rebar3 esp32_flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0

> Note.  This build step makes use of the [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_rebar3_plugin).  See the `README.md` for information about parameters for setting the serial port and baud rate for your platform.

Attach to the console usin gthe `monitor` Make target in the AtomVM ESP32 build:

    shell$ cd .../AtomVM/src/platform/esp32
    shell$ make monitor
